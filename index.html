        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Hi, I'm Angelica, a web developer based in San Antonio, TX. Originally from Mexico, I'm fluent in both
            English and Spanish, which allows me to effectively communicate with a diverse range of clients and
            collaborators.
            <br>
            Outside of work, I enjoy spending quality time with my family and connecting with friends. I'm also an avid
            podcast listener, always on the lookout for new and interesting topics to explore.
          </p>
          <p>I discovered my passion for web development as a way to invest in myself and provide more opportunities for
            my family. Since then, I've cultivated a strong set of skills in front-end and back-end development, as well
            as experience working with a variety of web technologies.
            <br>
            I'm committed to creating high-quality, user-friendly websites that meet the unique needs of each client.
            Whether you're looking to build a simple landing page or a complex web application, I'm excited to work with
            you to bring your vision to life.
          </p>
