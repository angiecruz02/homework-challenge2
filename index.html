      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Hi, I'm Angelica, a web developer based in San Antonio, TX. Originally from Mexico, I'm fluent in both
          English and Spanish, which allows me to effectively communicate with a diverse range of clients and
          collaborators.
          <br>
          Outside of work, I enjoy spending quality time with my family and connecting with friends. I'm also an avid
          podcast listener, always on the lookout for new and interesting topics to explore.
        </p>
        <p>I discovered my passion for web development as a way to invest in myself and provide more opportunities for
          my family. Since then, I've cultivated a strong set of skills in front-end and back-end development, as well
          as experience working with a variety of web technologies.
          <br>
          I'm committed to creating high-quality, user-friendly websites that meet the unique needs of each client.
          Whether you're looking to build a simple landing page or a complex web application, I'm excited to work with
          you to bring your vision to life.
        </p>
